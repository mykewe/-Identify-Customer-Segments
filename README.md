# Identify-Customer-Segments


This is my attempt at the Udacity unsupervised learning project in the introduction to machine learning with tensorflow nanodegree.

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany.
